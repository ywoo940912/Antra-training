Object-Oriented Programming

1.
   Public: Accessible from anywhere.
   Private: Accessible only within the same class.
   Protected: Accessible within the same class and derived classes.
   Internal: Accessible within the same assembly.
   Protected Internal: Accessible within the same assembly or by derived classes.
   Private Protected: Accessible within the same class and derived classes within the same assembly.

2. 
   static: Belongs to the type (class) rather than instances. Shared across all instances.
   const: Compile-time constant, must be assigned at declaration and cannot change.
   readonly: Can be assigned only at declaration or in the constructor, but not modified afterward.

3. 
   A constructor initializes an object when a class is instantiated. It sets default values and ensures proper initialization.

4. 
   The`partial keyword allows splitting a class, struct, or interface into multiple files. This is useful in large projects and for auto-generated code.

5. 
   A tuple is a lightweight data structure that can store multiple values of different types.

6. 
   A record is an immutable reference type used primarily for data storage. It provides built-in value equality.

7. 
   Overloading: Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
   Overriding: Providing a new implementation of a method in a derived class using `override`.

8. 
   Field: A variable declared inside a class.
   Property: A member that provides controlled access to a field.

9. 
   Use default values or the `params` keyword.

10. 
   Interfaces can be implemented by multiple classes.
   Interfaces do not have fields, while abstract classes can.
   Abstract classes can have implemented and abstract methods.
   
11. 
   All members in an interface are public by default.
